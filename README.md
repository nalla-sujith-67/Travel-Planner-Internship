# Travel Planner ✈️

A simple web application designed to help users plan and manage their travel itineraries. This initial version establishes the foundational **skeleton** and core security modules, meeting the week one development goals.

---

## Core Implementations (Week One)

This phase focused on creating a secure and functional backend structure for user management and trip data handling.

| Feature Area | Details | 
 | ----- | ----- | 
| **Authentication & Security** | Complete authentication module implemented using **bcrypt** for secure password hashing and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for session management. | 
| **Database Structure** | Database structures (schemas) are defined for all required entities. Currently, the core **Users** and **Trips** tables are actively utilized. | 
| **Trip Dashboard** | A personalized dashboard view allowing authenticated users to see a consolidated list of all their previous trip plans. | 
| **Trip Creation** | A functional interface to **create and save new trips** to the database. Newly created trips are immediately reflected on the user's dashboard. |

## Current Status & Next Steps

This version is a basic functional implementation, prioritizing core logic and security over advanced user interface design.

* **Styling:** Minimal styling has been applied.

* **Key Pending Module:** The **Google Places/Maps Integration** module is the next major feature to be implemented.

**Goal:** All remaining features, including advanced styling and the Google Places integration, will be completed **next week's task deadline**.
